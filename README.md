# GaitTrackingAlgorithm

The goal of this project was to find the best method of segmenting a video using semantic segmentation. Each individual frame was taken, analyzed, then put back into video format. Future studies would aim to discover a more accurate distance between steps in order to indicate whether the gait could be abnormal and be a marker for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease
